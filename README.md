Project Overview
​Provide a brief summary of what the project aims to achieve.
​Goal: Predict the final sale price of homes based on features like square footage, location, and number of rooms.
​Target Audience: Useful for real estate agents, home buyers, or sellers to estimate property values.
​2. Dataset Description
​Detail the data used to train the model.
​Source: (e.g., Kaggle, Boston Housing Dataset, or a custom CSV).
​Key Features: List important variables like Overall Quality, Total Square Feet, Year Built, and Neighborhood.
​Target Variable: The actual sale price of the house.
​3. Tech Stack
​List the tools and libraries used in the project:
​Language: Python.
4.​Libraries: pandas, numpy (data manipulation); scikit-learn (machine learning); matplotlib, seaborn (visualization).
​Backend: Flask (if you built a web app for predictions).
Describe your steps to make the project reproducible:
5​Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data (e.g., OneHotEncoding), and scaling numerical features.
​Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Briefly mention any insights found, such as correlations between features and price.
​Model Selection: Mention the algorithms you tested (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) and which performed best.
​Evaluation Metrics: Report your model's accuracy using metrics like R-squared (R^2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
​5. Installation & Usage
​Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for others to run your code locally.
6. Visualizations (Optional but Recommended)
​Adding a screenshot of your web interface or a graph showing predicted vs. actual prices makes your repository stand out.
